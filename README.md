[![Unit Tests](https://github.com/Sharpie/bolt-op_data/actions/workflows/unit_tests.yaml/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/Sharpie/bolt-op_data/actions/workflows/unit_tests.yaml)

The `op_data` module provides a [Bolt inventory plugin][bolt-plugins] for fetching
data from 1password vaults. This plugin wraps the [1password CLI tool][op-cli], `op`,
and is designed to support interactive execution of `bolt` commands from
an administrator's workstation.

## Setup

### Setup Requirements

The `op_data` plugin requires the 1password CLI tool, `op`, to be installed
and available on the `$PATH`. Mac users can install `op` via the
[Homebrew package manager][homebrew]:

```bash
brew cask install 1password-cli
```

  [homebrew]: https://brew.sh

Windows users can install `op` via the [WinGet package manager][winget]:

```ps1
winget install 1password-cli
```

  [winget]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/

Direct downloads and instructions for other operating systems can be found at:

  https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/#step-1-install-1password-cli

Once the CLI is installed, use the `op account add` command to connect 1password
accounts. The `my.1password.com` domain is used by personal accounts while
enterprise accounts typically use a custom domain: `<org-name>.1password.com`.
The `op_data` plugin supports using data from multiple account domains at once.
More information on connecting accounts to the `op` tool can be found here:

  https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/use-multiple-accounts


### Beginning with op_data

Once the `op` CLI tool is installed and connected to 1password account(s),
the `op_data` plugin can be used with a Bolt project by adding an entry
to the `modules` section of `bolt-project.yaml`:

```yaml
modules:
  # ...
  - name: 'sharpie-op_data'
    version_requirement: '0.3.0'
```

Next, the `inventory.yaml` file can be configured to retrieve values
using `_plugin: op_data`. For example, to make passwords or login
credentials available as variables:

```yaml
vars:
  do_token:
    _plugin: op_data
    account: my.1password.com
    vault: 'op_data Test Vault'
    id: 'DigitalOcean API Token'
    select: |
      fields[?id == 'credential'].value | [0]


  vsphere_login:
    _plugin: op_data
    account: example-corp.1password.com
    vault: 'Personal'
    id: 'vSphere Credential'
    select: |
      {user: fields[?id == 'username'].value|[0],
       pass: fields[?id == 'password'].value|[0]}
```

The `account` parameter is required and specifies which 1password account
domain to look data up in. The `id` parameter is also required and gives
the name or UUID of the data item to look up. The `vault` parameter is
optional, accepts a vault name or UUID, and is used to restrict a lookup to a
specific vault in a domain. The `inventory.yaml` file may be configured to
look up data from multiple account domains.

The `select` parameter can be used to extract or re-shape data using
JMESPath expressions:

  https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html

The [`jp` CLI tool][jp-cli] is useful for developing `select` expressions that
work against specific 1password records:

```bash
eval "$(op signin)"

op item get '<id>' [--vault '<vault>'] | jp '<select>'
```

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If the 1password desktop application is also installed, follow the steps
> to enable CLI integration to eliminate the need to manually run `op signin`
> in terminal sessions:
>
>   https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/app-integration/#step-1-turn-on-the-app-integration

The `op_data` plugin looks for 1password account credentials set in
`OP_SESSION_<account>` environment variables created by `op signin`
and will raise an error if credentials are missing. A typical user
session is shown below:

```bash
# Sign into 1password accounts (Linux or macOS)
eval $(op signin my.1password.com)
eval $(op signin example-corp.1password.com)

# Sign into 1password accounts (Windows)
Invoke-Expression $(op signin my.1password.com)
Invoke-Expression $(op signin example-corp.1password.com)

# Run bolt commands that use 1password data via inventory.yaml
bolt plan run ...

# Sign out of 1password, or close the terminal session
op signout my.1password.com
op signout example-corp.1password.com
```


## Limitations

  - Session credentials generated by `op signin` expire after 30 minutes.
    This expiration is not configurable as of the time of writing. Keep this
    time limit in mind when using long-running plans.
